### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I do think the topics discussed helped me get the functionality of the website. It was a little unclear at first though for me on the relationship between the three languages and it took me a while to see how they complemented each other. As well as I felt very lost with the CSS and the specficity and overall. I would've liked to practice more with interactions between all of them.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would've added more accessibility features such as alternate text and making sure it works with a screen reader. I would also have wanted to do more with error catching and handling for when I encountered missing data. I would also fix up the CSS of the pop-up to make it accessible.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Although I didn't demo, I really enjoyed the other's demos. I appreciated that they shared their challenges and it is something I will make sure to do. I would also want to share what else I would want to keep working on, as someone may have some suggestions!
